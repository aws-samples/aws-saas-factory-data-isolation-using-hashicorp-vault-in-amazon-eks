# SaaS Data Isolation with Dynamic Credentials Using HashiCorp Vault in Amazon EKS

The code shared here is intended to provide a sample implementation of SaaS Data Isolation with Dynamic Credentials Using HashiCorp Vault in Amazon EKS. The goal is to provide SaaS developers and architects with working code that will illustrate how multi-tenant SaaS applications can be design and delivered on AWS using Hashicorp Vault and Amazon EKS. The solution implements an identity model that simplifies the management of data access policies and credentials in isolated tenant environments. The focus here is more on giving developers a view into the working elements of the solution without going to the extent of making a full, production-ready solution.

Note that the instructions below are intended to give you step-by-step, how-to instructions for getting this solution up and running in your own AWS account. For a general description and overview of the solution, please see the 
[blog post here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/saas-data-isolation-with-dynamic-credentials-using-hashicorp-vault-in-amazon-eks/).

For instructions and sample deployment code based on Terraform refer to the 
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/hashicorp-publicsector/blog-dynamic-saas-cluster-aws-vault).

## Setting up the environment

> :warning: The Cloud9 workspace should be built by an IAM user with Administrator privileges, not the root account user. Please ensure you are logged in as an IAM user, not the root account user.

1. Create new Cloud9 Environment
    * Launch Cloud9 in your closest region Ex: `https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home?region=us-west-2`
    * Select Create environment
    * Name it whatever you want, click Next.
    * Choose “t3.small” for instance type, take all default values and click Create environment
2. Create EC2 Instance Role
    * Follow this [deep link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles$new?step=review&commonUseCase=EC2%2BEC2&selectedUseCase=EC2&policies=arn:aws:iam::aws:policy%2FAdministratorAccess) to create an IAM role with Administrator access.
    * Confirm that AWS service and EC2 are selected, then click Next to view permissions.
    * Confirm that AdministratorAccess is checked, then click `Next: Tags` to assign tags.
    * Take the defaults, and click `Next: Review` to review.
    * Enter `dynamic-policy-ref-arch-admin` for the Name, and click `Create role`.
3. Remove managed credentials and attach EC2 Instance Role to Cloud9 Instance
    * Click the gear in the upper right-hand corner of the IDE which opens settings. Click the `AWS Settings` on the left and under `Credentials` slide the button to the left for `AWS managed temporary credentials`. The button should be greyed out when done, indicating it's off.
    * Click the round Button with an alphabet in the upper right-hand corner of the IDE and click `Manage EC2 Instance`. This will take you to the EC2 portion of the AWS Console
    * Right-click the EC2 instance and in the fly-out menu, click `Security` -> `Modify IAM Role`
    * Choose the Role you created in step 3 above. It should be titled `dynamic-policy-ref-arch-admin` and click `Save`.
4. Clone the repo and run the setup script
    * Return to the Cloud9 IDE
    * In the upper left part of the main screen, click the round green button with a `+` on it and click `New Terminal`
    * Enter the following in the terminal window

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-saas-factory-data-isolation-using-hashicorp-vault-in-amazon-eks.git
    cd aws-saas-factory-data-isolation-using-hashicorp-vault-in-amazon-eks
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
   ```

   This [script](./setup.sh) sets up Kubernetes tools, updates the AWS CLI and installs other dependencies that we'll use later. It also creates an S3 bucket for centrally managing the Vault Agent Templates, and creates the relevant IAM policy to allow the Vault Agent to read the templates and render secrets. Take note of the final output of this script. If everything worked correctly, you should see the message that the you're good to continue creating the EKS cluster. If you do not see this message, please do not continue. Ensure that the Administrator EC2 role was created and successfully attached to the EC2 instance that's running your Cloud9 IDE. Also ensure you turned off `AWS managed temporary credentials` inside your Cloud9 IDE (refer to steps 2 and 3).

5. Create the EKS Cluster
    * Edit the script `deploy-eks.sh` to specify a CIDR range for the EKS Cluster VPC
    * Make sure that the CIDR range does not overlap with any existing network segments and route table entries
    * This script will be adding a route in the route table associated with this Cloud9 Instance for the EKS Cluster private endpoints
    * Run the following script to create a cluster configuration file, and subsequently provision the cluster using `eksctl`:

    ```bash
    chmod +x deploy-eks.sh
    ./deploy-eks.sh
    ```

    The cluster will take approximately 30 minutes to deploy.
    
    This [script](./deploy-eks.sh) creates:
    
    a. An IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA) to provide S3 bucket access for the Vault Agent, with a trust policy based on the EKS Cluster's associated OIDC provider
    
    b. An IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA) to enable the Vault Server to call STS AssumeRole

6. Create and Populate DynamoDB Table
    > :warning: Close the terminal window that you created the cluster in, and open a new terminal before starting this step otherwise you may get errors about your AWS_REGION not set.
    * Open a **_NEW_** terminal window and `cd` back into `aws-saas-factory-data-isolation-using-hashicorp-vault-in-amazon-eks` and run the following script:

    ```bash
    chmod +x create-dynamodb-table.sh
    ./create-dynamodb-table.sh
    ```

    This [script](./create-dynamodb-table.sh) completes the following steps:

    a. Creates DynamoDB table Products
    
    b. Populates the Products table with data used for testing the silo and pooled tenant isolation scenarios

    ```bash
    cd vault-engine
    chmod +x deploy-vault.sh
    ./deploy-vault.sh
    ```

    This [script](./vault-engine/deploy-vault.sh) completes the following steps:

    a. Creates Vault Role in IAM, with an STS AssumeRole trust policy
    
    b. Creates Vault DynamoDB policy in IAM

    c. Attaches the DynamoDB policy to Vault Role
    
    d. Creates an AssumeRole policy and attaches it to the Vault IRSA
    
    e. Creates Vault namespace in EKS Cluster
